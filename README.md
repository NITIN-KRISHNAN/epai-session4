# Session 4 - Numeric Types II

**Qualean** class that is inspired by Boolean+Quantum concepts. We can assign it only 3 possible **real** states. True, False, and Maybe (1, 0, -1) but it internally picks an imaginary state. The moment you assign it a real number, it immediately finds an imaginary number **random.uniform**(-1, 1) and multiplies with it and stores that number internally after using Bankers rounding to 10th decimal place

Magic methods of class Qualean are implemented

## \__init__

The \__init__ method is similar to constructors in C++ and Java. Constructors are used to initialize the object.

## \_\_add__

##\__or__

## \__repr__

## \__str__

## \__add__

## \__eq__

## \__float__

## \__ge__

## \__gt__

## \__invertsign__

## \__le__

## \__lt__

## \__mul__

## \__sqrt__

## \__bool__
